## Project Concept
I have chosen the restaurant Management Api. this designed to assist the restaurant manage their operation through concentrated sytem. This will allow the administrators, managers and customers to perform their different action according to their roles like managing menus, controlling orders and about the restaurant information. I chose this concept because i think this is relatable and like real world scenario for applying the backend concepts like authentication, CRUD options and any other options.

## Scope and Functionality 
The APi will include the following features:
Users:
Handles user registration and authentication using Firebase Authentication.
Implements role-based authorization for Admins, Staff, and Customers.
Admins can manage users and roles.

Menus:
Manages food and drink items, including categories, prices, and availability.
Allows admins or managers to create, update, or delete menu items.
Customers can view available menu items.

Orders:
Handles customer orders by linking menu items, restaurant branches, and user accounts.
Allows staff to update order statuses (e.g., preparing, ready, completed).

Customers can view their own order history.

## Course Content Alignment
This project closely align with the course content as Express.js Api development for building snd structuring restful routes, firebase authentication for user login, middleware and error handling for source consistant behavior, testing with jest for validating enpoints and middleware, swagger Documentation for Api documentation and postman collection for testing the endpoints and token authentication.
